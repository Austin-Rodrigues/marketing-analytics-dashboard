[server]
headless = true
```

4. Also create a file called `runtime.txt` in the root:
```
python-3.11
```

5. Commit both files
6. Go back to Streamlit Cloud and click "Reboot"

### **Fix 3: Simplify requirements.txt Even More**

Try the absolute minimum:
```
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=2.0.0
plotly>=5.0.0
```

---

### **Fix 4: Delete and Redeploy**

Sometimes Streamlit Cloud gets stuck:

1. In Streamlit Cloud, go to your app settings
2. Click **"Delete app"**
3. Create a **new app** from scratch
4. Select your repository again
5. Deploy fresh

---

## 🎯 **Most Likely Issue**

The problem is probably:
- **Python 3.13 compatibility** (it's too new)
- **Specific version numbers** in requirements.txt causing conflicts

---

## ✅ **Recommended Action Plan**

**Do this in order:**

1. **Update requirements.txt** (remove version numbers):
```
   streamlit
   pandas
   plotly
   numpy
```

2. **Add runtime.txt** to force Python 3.11:
```
   python-3.11
